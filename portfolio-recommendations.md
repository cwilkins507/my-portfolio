# Portfolio Transformation: collinwilkins.com

## The Problem with Your Current Site

Your site title says "AI Automation & Python Consulting" — but when I fetch the page, that's essentially all there is. No content. No story. No reason for Google to rank you. No reason for a potential client to trust you.

Compare this to Nick Saraev and Michael Girdley — both are *content machines* that happen to sell consulting/services. You're currently the inverse: a services page that happens to exist.

---

## What Girdley & Saraev Do Right (That You're Missing)

### 1. They Lead with Value, Not Services

**Girdley:** "Start building beautiful businesses" — immediately offers free guide, newsletter, videos. Services are buried.

**Saraev:** "Your straight-line path to a thriving AI & automation business" — free 6-hour courses, free roadmap, journal entries. Products are secondary.

**You:** "AI Automation & Python Consulting" — this is a business card, not a destination.

### 2. They Have *Content Flywheels*

Both sites generate organic traffic through:
- **Long-form journal entries / newsletters** (Saraev's biography is 5,000+ words)
- **Free educational content** (Saraev: 57 hours of free YouTube courses)
- **Specific, searchable topics** (Girdley: "How to write a killer job description", Saraev: "Make.com vs N8N in 2025")

This content:
- Ranks in Google
- Gets shared
- Builds trust before anyone ever contacts them
- Positions them as *the* expert

### 3. They Show Process & Thinking, Not Just Results

Nick's biography walks through every business he's built, what worked, what failed, and why. This creates parasocial trust — you feel like you *know* him before you ever email him.

Girdley shares his actual systems and frameworks. People buy from him because they've already gotten value from him.

## Proposed Content Strategy for collinwilkins.com

### Core Content Pillars (Pick 2-3)

Based on your positioning as an AI/automation consultant in the Upwork space, here are high-value content areas:

1. **"How I Built X" Case Studies**
   - Real automations you've built (anonymized if needed)
   - Cost savings, time saved, technical approach
   - SEO targets: "python automation case study", "n8n workflow examples", "make.com real examples"

2. **Technical Tutorials (MOFU/BOFU)**
   - "How to build [specific automation] with Python"
   - "Make.com vs Zapier vs N8N for [use case]"
   - These rank AND pre-qualify leads who want exactly what you do

3. **Consulting/Freelancing Meta-Content**
   - "What I've learned from 100+ Upwork projects"
   - "Why I turned down this $10k project" (contrarian = shareable)
   - "My client intake process" (shows professionalism)

4. **Building in Public / Journal Entries** (Saraev's superpower)
   - Monthly revenue updates (if comfortable)
   - Current projects, experiments, learnings
   - This builds *relationship* at scale

### Specific Page Additions

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/about` or `/bio` | Long-form story like Saraev's — your background, how you got into automation, your philosophy. 1,500-3,000 words. |
| `/work` or `/case-studies` | 3-5 detailed project breakdowns |
| `/blog` or `/journal` | Ongoing content (2-4 posts/month to start) |
| `/resources` or `/tools` | Free templates, checklists, starter scripts (lead magnets) |
| `/contact` | Simple form + Calendly link |

## SEO-Specific Recommendations

### 1. Target Intent, Not Just Keywords

**Bad:** "Python automation" (too broad, informational)

**Good:** "How to automate invoice processing with Python" (specific, solution-oriented, closer to purchase intent)

### 2. Create "Pillar + Cluster" Content

**Pillar:** "The Complete Guide to Business Automation with Python" (3,000+ words)

**Clusters:** (link back to pillar)
- "Automating email reports with Python"
- "Web scraping for price monitoring"
- "Connecting Google Sheets to your CRM with Python"

This builds topical authority and internal linking that Google rewards.

### 3. Schema Markup

Add structured data for:
- `Person` schema (you as the expert)
- `Service` schema (your offerings)
- `Article` schema (blog posts)

### 4. E-E-A-T Signals

**Experience:** Show actual projects, screenshots, results
**Expertise:** Technical depth in content
**Authoritativeness:** Guest posts, podcast appearances, LinkedIn presence
**Trust:** Testimonials, client logos, clear contact info

---

## Design & Styling Recommendations

### Current Problem

Most "developer portfolios" look the same: dark mode, monospace font, minimal. This signals "I'm technical" but not "I'm someone you want to hire."

### Recommended Direction: **Editorial Warmth**

Think: a magazine that happens to be about automation. Readable. Human. Professional but not sterile.

### Typography

**Avoid:** Inter, Roboto, Arial (generic)

**Consider:**

| Use | Font Suggestion | Why |
|-----|-----------------|-----|
| Headlines | **Fraunces** (serif, variable) | Warm, distinctive, modern-classic |
| Body | **Source Serif Pro** or **Lora** | Highly readable, editorial feel |
| Code/Technical | **JetBrains Mono** | Modern monospace for code blocks |

Alternative direction if you want more modern/tech feel:
- Headlines: **Space Grotesk** or **Satoshi**
- Body: **Atkinson Hyperlegible** (accessibility-focused, unique)

### Color Palette

**Avoid:** Generic tech blue, purple gradients, pure black backgrounds

**Option 1: Warm & Approachable**
```
Background: #FDFBF7 (warm off-white)
Text: #1a1a1a (soft black)
Accent: #D35400 (burnt orange)
Secondary: #34495E (slate blue)
```

**Option 2: Modern Dark (done right)**
```
Background: #0D1117 (GitHub dark)
Text: #E6EDF3 (warm white)
Accent: #58A6FF (link blue)
Secondary: #7EE787 (success green)
```

**Option 3: Distinctive & Bold**
```
Background: #F5F0E6 (parchment)
Text: #2C3E50 (dark slate)
Accent: #16A085 (teal)
Highlight: #F39C12 (amber)
```

### Layout Principles

1. **Generous whitespace** — don't cram. Let content breathe.
2. **Readable line length** — max 65-75 characters per line
3. **Clear hierarchy** — one H1, logical H2/H3 structure
4. **Progressive disclosure** — don't show everything at once

### Homepage Structure (Suggested)

## On the "Cringe" Factor (Twitter/Newsletter/LinkedIn)

You said these feel cringey. Here's the reframe:

**You don't need to be performative.** Look at Saraev's approach:
- He writes *journal entries*, not thinkpieces
- He shares what he's *actually doing*, not motivational fluff
- It reads like a smart friend updating you, not a marketing funnel

**The minimum viable presence:**
1. **LinkedIn:** Post 1x/week when you publish a blog post. That's it. No dancing, no hashtag storms.
2. **No Twitter required** — but if you do, just share interesting things you're building/learning
3. **No newsletter required to start** — but add an email capture for "new posts" on your blog

The goal isn't to become an influencer. It's to have *something* when people Google your name or want to vet you before hiring.

---

## The Minimum Viable Portfolio (Start Here)

If you do nothing else, do these 5 things:

1. **Write a proper About/Bio page** (1,000+ words, your story, what you believe, how you work)

2. **Create 3 case studies** (even brief ones: problem → approach → result)

3. **Publish one long-form blog post** targeting a keyword like "how to automate [X] with Python" — something you actually know

4. **Add schema markup** (Person + Organization + Service)

5. **Update your homepage** to lead with value and story, not services

---

## Measuring Success

Track these (Google Search Console is free):
- Impressions for target keywords
- Clicks from organic search
- Pages indexed
- Referring domains

Timeline expectation: SEO compounds. Expect 3-6 months before significant organic traffic. But the content you write now will work for you for years.

---

## Summary

| What Girdley/Saraev Have | What You Need |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Newsletter with 42k+ subscribers | Start with blog + email capture |
| Extensive content library | 3-5 strong pieces to start |
| Distinct visual identity | Warm, editorial design (not generic dev portfolio) |
| Clear value proposition | Story + process + proof |
| Multiple CTAs (newsletter, products, consulting) | Simple: read more or contact me |

The path is clear: **become useful on the internet, and the internet will send you clients.** The site should be a place where people who need automation help learn things, come to trust you, and eventually reach out.

You don't need to be everywhere. You need to be *somewhere*, consistently, with genuine value.
