# Portfolio Improvement Proposal: collinwilkins.com

## The Problem

Your current site appears to be a minimal portfolio with very little indexable content. Google can't rank what doesn't exist. Meanwhile, the sites you admire (Girdley, Saraev) are content machines that pull organic traffic through searchable, valuable writing.

## What Girdley & Saraev Do Well

### Girdley
- **Clear positioning**: "Beautiful Business" — immediately know what he's about
- **Content hub structure**: Written / Video / Podcast / Downloads all accessible from nav
- **Multiple CTAs**: Newsletter, courses, "Work With Me" — but feels like value exchange, not promotion
- **SEO-friendly blog** with discrete, searchable topics (playbooks, book recs, advice)

### Saraev
- **The Biography page you linked is brilliant** — it's a 5,000+ word SEO asset disguised as personal story
- **Narrative-driven authority**: His journey from promotions company → AI → $100K/month reads like a case study
- **Strategic keywords baked in**: "AI automation agency", "Make.com", "Upwork", "freelance developer"
- **Crystal clear outcome**: He helps people build automation agencies. No confusion.
- **Passive CTA**: Email at the bottom. Not pushy. Works because the content did the selling.

## Your Strategy: Content-Driven Inbound

You want clicks to LinkedIn, inbound emails, Upwork applications → consulting/side projects.

Here's the framework:

```
[Long-form SEO content] → [Soft CTA on every page] → [LinkedIn / Email / Upwork]
```

No newsletter funnel. No Twitter grind. Just **searchable content that demonstrates expertise**.

## Proposed Site Architecture

```
collinwilkins.com/
├── / (Home)                    → Who you are + what you do + featured work
├── /about                      → Your Saraev-style biography (the SEO anchor)
├── /work                       → Case studies / projects (expanded from current)
├── /writing                    → Blog/articles hub
│   ├── /writing/[slug]         → Individual posts
├── /services                   → What you offer (consulting, builds, etc.)
└── /contact                    → Simple: email + LinkedIn + Upwork
```

---

## Key Changes

### 1. **Add a Long-Form "About" / Biography Page**

This is your SEO anchor. Saraev's biography ranks for terms like "AI automation agency" because it tells a story while naturally including keywords.

**Your version could include:**
- Your background and how you got into tech/design/whatever your focus is
- Projects and their outcomes (with specifics: "built X that did Y")
- Your philosophy/approach
- Skills and tools you work with
- What you're looking for (consulting, interesting projects, collaborations)

**Word count target**: 2,000-4,000 words. This isn't vanity — it's surface area for Google.

---

### 2. **Start a "Writing" Section**

Not a newsletter. Just searchable articles on topics you know well.

**Content types that work for SEO + demonstrate expertise:**

| Type | Example Topics |
|------|----------------|
| How-to guides | "How to [do thing you're good at]" |
| Case studies | "How I built [project] for [client/self]" |
| Tool comparisons | "[Tool A] vs [Tool B] for [use case]" |
| Problem/solution posts | "Why [common approach] fails and what to do instead" |
| Build logs | "Building [side project]: Week 1" |

**Frequency**: Even 1-2 posts per month creates compounding SEO value.

---

### 3. **Expand Project Pages into Case Studies**

Current portfolio sites usually show: Screenshot + title + maybe a link.

Better approach: Each project gets its own page with:
- The problem/context
- Your approach
- The outcome (metrics if possible)
- Tech used
- What you learned

This makes each project a searchable, indexable asset.

---

### 4. **Add a Services Page**

Even if you're not actively selling, having a `/services` page:
- Tells Google what you do
- Gives inbound visitors a clear "here's how to work with me"
- Can link to Upwork profile or contact form

Keep it simple:
- 2-3 service offerings
- What's included
- How to get started (email/call/Upwork)

---

### 5. **Soft CTAs Everywhere (Not Cringey)**

You don't need pop-ups or "SUBSCRIBE NOW" banners.

Instead, every page ends with something like:

> **Want to work together?**  
> I take on consulting projects and interesting builds.  
> [Email me](mailto:you@email.com) · [LinkedIn](link) · [Upwork](link)

Or for articles:

> **More writing**: [Link to /writing]  
> **About me**: [Link to /about]

---

## Design Recommendations

Based on the frontend-design skill and avoiding "AI slop":

### Typography
- **Avoid**: Inter, Roboto, system fonts
- **Consider**: JetBrains Mono (for code aesthetic), Newsreader (editorial), IBM Plex (technical/clean)

### Color
- Pick a bold direction: dark mode with high contrast, or light with a single strong accent
- Avoid purple gradients on white (the AI cliché)

### Layout
- Use generous whitespace
- Consider asymmetric layouts or grid-breaking elements for personality
- Let the content breathe

### Motion
- Subtle page-load animations (staggered reveals)
- Hover states that feel intentional
- Don't overdo it

## Implementation Priority

| Priority | Action | SEO Impact | Effort |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| 🔴 High | Write long-form About/Biography page | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium |
| 🔴 High | Add /writing section + 3-5 initial posts | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | High |
| 🟡 Medium | Expand projects into case studies | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium |
| 🟡 Medium | Add /services page | ⭐⭐⭐ | Low |
| 🟢 Low | Design refresh (typography, color) | ⭐⭐ | Medium |

---

## Content Ideas to Start

Based on a consulting/side-projects focus:

1. **"How I approach [your specialty]"** — positions you as thoughtful
2. **"Building [side project]: A technical deep-dive"** — shows capability
3. **"[Tool] for [use case]: What I've learned"** — attracts people searching for that tool
4. **"Lessons from [X] freelance/consulting projects"** — social proof + wisdom
5. **Case study of your best project** — the "hired you already in their head" piece

---

## What This Gets You

- **Organic traffic** from people searching for topics you write about
- **Pre-sold inbound leads** who read your stuff and already trust you
- **Upwork credibility** (link to your site/articles in proposals)
- **LinkedIn content fodder** (share articles there without "building a pipeline")
- **Compounding asset** — every article you write keeps working forever

---

## Next Steps

1. **Write your About page** — this is the highest-leverage single action
2. **Pick 3 article topics** you could write without research (from experience)
3. **Decide on site structure** — can iterate on design later
4. **Set a publishing cadence** — even 1x/month works
