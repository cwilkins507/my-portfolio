## 1. The $2 Million Hook: Why I Code for ROI
Most engineers start their story with a "Hello World" script. Mine starts with a $2 million liability.

In 2018, while working in Finance at Ford Motor Company, I noticed a hitch in the machine. We had interest rate spreads that needed daily updates across dozens of regions and thousands of contracts. This was during the end of ZIRP and we held our breaths each time the Fed announced a meeting 

Our manual lead time? 30 days. 

I did the math: if the Fed hiked rates, that 30-day lag could cost us roughly $2 million annually. 

I proposed an automated fix. The response? *"We don't have the technical resources or skills to do that."* 

So, I built what I could myself. I cut that 7-day lead time down to hours. That was my inflection point. I realized that code isn't just about syntax; it’s a high-leverage business tool. Today, I don't just build "features" - I focus on building systems that solve expensive problems and reclaim thousands of wasted human hours.

## 2. Philosophy: Engineering as a Profit Center
I am a **Tech Optimist** and an **Opportunist**. I believe the biggest lifts in a company don’t come from "Big AI" magic wands, but from removing the friction points that compound over time.

Solve the "death by thousand cuts" issues.

If your team is spending 20% of their week clicking "Run" on a Postman collection or manually importing contacts, you aren't just losing time—you're losing the opportunity to innovate.

### My Precision Stack:
*   **Infrastructure and Architecture as Code (Terraform):** Consistency is non-negotiable. If it isn't "on the paper" (in code), it doesn't exist. I build systems that are documented by their own existence, ensuring that if I (or any engineer) leave, the logic remains.
*   **Robustness over "Shiny":** I handle the edge cases, the silent failures, and the opportunity costs. I use AWS Lambda and distributed queues (SQS) not because they're trendy, but because they scale without breaking the UI—and the budget.

## 3. The "Special Sauce": From the Boardroom to the Terminal
I spent the first half of my career in Sales and Business Development (moving through 7 states and 13 territories for Ford). I’ve been the "Field Rep" and I’ve been the "Lead Engineer." 

**This is my mote.** 

Most developers look at a Jira ticket. I look at a business process. Because I’ve lived the "shared pain" of operations and manual data entry, I can tie technical architecture directly to business value. I speak Finance, I speak Sales, and I speak Python.

## 4. Core Specialization: Python & Agentic Workflows
I specialize in **Python Automation Scripting** and **AI/LLM Systems**. 

I don't just use OpenAI for chat. I build production-ready agentic workflows. One of my recent scripts pulled GitHub PRs, Bitbucket requests, and Asana milestones across an entire enterprise squad—generating a comprehensive summary of business impact and shipping it to leadership every Friday at 4 PM on the dot. 

It didn't just "save time"—it provided vertical visibility that didn't exist before.

**Key Tools:**
*   **Data Pipelines:** `requests`, `beautifulsoup`, `pandas`.
*   **Backend Services:** Java, Spring Boot, Postgres.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS (Lambda, SQS, Fargate), Azure, GCP.

## 5. Case Studies in Impact

### Saving $5M/Year: The Remote Dealership Audit (IoT)
Before I arrived, dealership audits were a physical, expensive requirement. I led the re-architecture of a remote inventory auditing application that handled telemetry for over 450,000 vehicles. Using Kafka and IoT microservices, we ingested 600,000 daily events, allowing for real-time geo-fencing and verification.
*   **Result:** Saved $5,000,000 annually and modernized how Ford manages dealer risk.

### Modernizing Compliance: Scaling the Morningstar Engine
At Morningstar, I inherited a compliance system that was effectively "running on Postman." Engineers were manually throttling API calls to avoid crashing the UI schema. I implemented a scheduler with AWS SQS to manage throughput based on real-time database utilization.
*   **The Surgery:** Transitioned from manual API calls for 80+ recordkeepers to a full event-driven architecture.
*   **Result:** Reduced manual run-time by 90%, enabling the business to onboard 7 additional recordkeepers with zero added overhead.

## 6. Behind the Code: Discipline and Context
I’m an **INTJ** with a relentless focus on continuous learning. 

*   **Consistency:** I’ve tracked my nutrition and hit the gym 3-5 times a week for the last 8 years. I apply that same "incremental gains" mindset to my codebases.
*   **Adaptability:** I’ve lived in Dallas, Atlanta, Denver, Boston, and now Detroit. I am a generalist by choice—meaning I can drop into any legacy system, find the value, and fix the leak.
*   **The Soundtrack:** I work to a mix of country music and 2000s rock. Creed and Nickelback are ok by me.

## 7. How to Work With Me
I take on high-stakes consulting projects and custom automation builds. If you have a process that is "good enough" but costs you thousands in manual effort, let’s talk.
